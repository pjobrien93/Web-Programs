<h1>Best Places to Nap on Campus</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Gates Dell Complex - with a plethora of couches, this newer building will help you get some needed Z's in between classes</li>
  <li>The Union - while this bulding doesn't have as many couches, it's dark lighting will help you melt away into three or four chairs pushed together</li>
  <li>Sixth Floor PCL - find a corner of this quite floor, push together a coffee table and two chairs, and you have yourself the perfect home during finals week.</li>
</ol>
